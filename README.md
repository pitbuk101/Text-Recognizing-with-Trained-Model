Objective: Design & develop a pipeline to Extract data from unstructured documents


Here I proposed two solutions :

- my_solution.ipynb : It is in traditional way where first Preprocessing of image with opencv and then use of OCR libraries to gain             information from images.

- Alternate_Solution.ipynb : It is a Deep Learning Pre traind Model with text detection and recognisation with pyTorch and OCR , which can be customized as per our use. I selected this because of the robust ML pipeline that is used first text detection (localizing words), then text recognition (identify all characters in the word), which gives the edge to extract information seamlessly.
